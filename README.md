# Unsupervised Learning of MNIST dataset by STDP

This small project is to translate Brian 1 code from Paper "Unsupervised learning of digit recognition using spike-timing-dependent plasticity" written by PU Diehl to Brian 2 version. 

Status: It's still during translation.



# Current problem

the brian 2 code can run without error report. But the test of the original paper's trained model is very low accuracy comparing with Brian 1 code. 

Possible reasons

1. Unit problem. The Brian 2 cannot use brian_no_unit. 

2. 

If anyone wants to join the project or give any suggestion, I'll really appreciate it.
